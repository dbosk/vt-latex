# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## What this is

An academic paper (work in progress), *"LaTeX through the lens of variation
theory: misconceptions and critical aspects of document preparation"*
(Bosk), cataloguing learners' misconceptions of LaTeX — the compile model,
error handling, semantic markup — and analysing how to teach against them
using phenomenography and variation theory. Companion to
vt-prog-misconceptions (same method, introductory programming), vt-debug
(debugging), and vt-terminal (the Unix shell); it grows out of the datintro
course-revision work in the introtools repository (see
`introtools:evaluation/improvements.md` and
`introtools:literature/mental-models.md`).

Distinctive constraint: the LaTeX-misconception literature is essentially
empty (the seed round found only Knauff & Nejasmic 2014, an efficiency
comparison of professionals). This paper therefore leans on adjacent
literatures (error messages, markup education) and on datintro course data
more than the companions do.

## Build

```sh
make            # builds both article.pdf and slides.pdf
make article.pdf
make clean
```

Build machinery comes from the `makefiles/` and `didactic/` git submodules;
after a fresh clone:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Requires a TeX distribution with `minted` (Pygments, `-shell-escape`),
`pythontex`, and `biber`. Outputs land in `ltxobj/`; `article.pdf` and
`slides.pdf` at the root are symlinks.

## Architecture: one source, two outputs

The content `.tex` files are compiled twice from the same source — once as a
prose article (`article.tex`, memoir + beamerarticle) and once as Beamer
slides (`slides.tex`). Both input the same `preamble.tex` and the same
content files (`introduction.tex`, `background.tex`, `method.tex`,
`compilation.tex`, `errors.tex`, `markup.tex`, `related-work.tex`,
`conclusions.tex`, `search-protocol.tex`).

Consequences when editing content files:

- Every content file starts with `\mode*`; slide-only material goes in
  `\mode<presentation>{...}` or `\begin{frame}...`; article-only prose is the
  default outside frames.
- Research questions live in `restatable` environments (thm-restate) —
  stated once in `introduction.tex` **inside a frame** (so both builds
  execute them), restated with `\rqmisconceptions*` etc. in `method.tex` and
  `conclusions.tex`. Never write literal "RQ1".
- Citations use `\autocite` (biblatex verbose style; didactic places them in
  the margin/footnotes).

## Bibliography discipline

`misconceptions.bib` entries carry provenance blocks (CLAIM / FOUND-VIA /
PICKED / QUOTE / VERIFIED) per the backing-claims skill; do not add a
citation without one, and do not cite beyond what the VERIFIED line
supports. Knauff & Nejasmic 2014 must not be over-claimed: professionals,
text-typing tasks, equations favoured LaTeX. Entries with `VERIFIED: TODO`
(du Boulay 1981, Ben-Ari 1998) are tracked as introtools issues #124–#125.
`theory.bib` holds the variation-theory base (NCOL etc.), shared with the
companion papers.

## State of the paper

Scaffold stage: research questions, method skeleton (including a planned
course-data phase), seeded literature, and preliminary aspect/pattern
analyses per chapter are in place. The systematic literature-search phase
(phase two in `search-protocol.tex`) has not run yet; `% TODO`/`% XXX`
comments mark the open work.
